What's goin' on, he said? I don't really know. An awful lot of things.
Started with Python, fully immersed in statistics for now. Discovered Data Science.
Will it be a viable profession for an old guy like me who's just starting?
Don't know, but for now really enjoying it. Then discovered also R, used in this
Coursera course "Inferential Statistics". Maybe liking it even more than Python!
The magic of graphs and maths is fascinating me.Just finished the last project,
a study on the gss dataset. After that the Coursera career path advices to take a course
on business analytics, by a professor of the Duke University (i already took one course taught by him,
"Data Science Math Skills"). Also visiting a lot DataCamp, which in my experience is  a lot better than
DataQuest.
That's all for now.
