Ok, here again. Trying to write one line or two. Created this blog to report my mistrials with Python. And now, that i discovered Data Science there is still a lot more going on.
Again, yes. I set up this blog from online info. It was not easy. And the posts don't come out well. As for now, i'm editing this text in that old beast called Vim. If you dont' know it.. it is one of the most ancient text editors. It is awkward but strangely satysfing. 
So, as for now :
1) Following through the "Inferential Statistics" course on Coursera. R is a new tool in the bag and i quite like it. 
2) Halfway through the Python developer path on Jetskills Acade;y. Some interesting stuff, doing a "text-based browser". Going on quite slow as i am focusing on statistics.
I got the "Responsive Web Design" certification from Freecodecamp, but i'm not very proud of it. My projects suck and i got it anyway. It was useful to learn a bit of the web design basics, enough to know that's not where i'm heading.

Other resources:

-IntrostatswithR, a great introductory book on statistics and R, very good stuff.
- Peeked inside ThinkStats and Data Science from Scratch, though i understand a bit it is pretty advanced material for know.

See you next.
