Donc, voyons d'écrire en français? No. I talk already too much french.

Quindi in italiano? Neanche, ne parlo troppo poco, non scriverei niente di sensato.

So i'm still up and running, and programming, most often on the JetSkylls Academy where I've already completed about 5 projects, all published on GitHub.

Today I got an interview for a job, nothing to do with programming anyway. Import-Export. Not much experience in the field despite the plethora of jobs i did. Just some clerk experience. Anway, i did not bad in the interview.

I'll see.
